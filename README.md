# LaunchPad Labs Challenge

Challenge by Nathan Chiu

A simple table of different popular javascript client side libraries and metrics on 3 categories: watchers, open issues, and network count.
A couple of objectives include the table refreshing these statistics without a page refresh as well as being able to sort columns so that
you are able to in a sense see development metrics when you want to choose a client side library.

Technologies used:
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

Notes:
Simple (perhaps inefficient) polling is done using javascript's ```setInterval``` function and querying the Github API.
